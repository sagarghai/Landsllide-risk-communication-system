#Landslide Risk Communication System
#### A communication tool to communicate with audience a region.

Mandi is a small town in Himachal Pradesh, India. It is scarcely populated with a high risk of Landslides in majority of localities. Thus it is imminent to make people aware of landslides and the possibilities of these occurring. 

This module uses Twillio messaging API and works on python GUI to detect a landslide occurence based on rainfall pattern and sends in a warning to all people in that region. If the effective possibility is less than a threshhold, then either an awareness or a learning message is sent on peple's phone. 

Installation : 
install tkinter, python 2.7, twillio, gspread, google translate python package and then just run gui.py.
